    the inland endmember is defined as the LSR inland of the coastal member, as well as the influxes for the eyre river,
     Ashley tributaries, and cust inflow. we intended to set the selwyn streams and northern boundary flux (lowburn) to 
     inland, but a bug in the mt3d run meant that they were not interpreted as inland.  we did not re-run due to 
     programme time constraints LSR on both sides of the Waimakariri river were set
     we envisage a third endmember (i.e. alpine river water), but due to time constraints we are assuming that the sum 
     of all of these endmembers is 1 for each observation point and did not run the alpine river endmember"""
